### Lab Questions for the Compiler Design and Construction Lab

1. Write a program that constructs the DFA that accepts the language `L = {w | w is a string of a's and b's such that w always starts with 'ab'}`.
2. Write a program that constructs the NFA that ends with 'ab'`.
3. Write a program for `comment validation`.
4. Write a program that converts an infix expression to a postfix expression.
5. Write a program that converts an infix expression to three-address code.
6. Write a program for identifier validation.
7. Write a program that constructs the NFA to DFA.
8. Write a program for data type conversion (int to float, float to int).
9. Write a program for tokenization (checking whether keyword, identifier, operator, etc.).
10. Write a program for the shift-reduce parser for the input string `id+id*id`:
    ```
    E => E+E | E*E | (E) | id
    ```
